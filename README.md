Before using this program, you need to download UIC's grade distribution. This is only public to UIC students and should not be used by non-UIC students. Therefore, I have not shared the file.

THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO... 
take an input of any course taught at UIC, then rank all of the professors who taught the course from *best* to worst --- see next line
*best* professor being the one who had given the most A's as a percentage of total students in the class. 

-- the data being analyzed is collected from Spring 2023 semester -- 
it is public information on the UIC website (but NOT ORGANIZED OR KNOWN BY MANY people at all, rendering it close to useless) -- this program ultimately serves to fix whats in those paranthesis.

-- this is not to be confused with ratemyprofessor.com, which only looks at students reviews of a professor which are usually on the extremes of the spectrum. (more on next line)
This, on the other hand, takes the only important, concrete data(grades) and uses them to give a very accurate ranking of professors per course. --
